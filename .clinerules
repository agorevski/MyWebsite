# Cline Rules for MyWebsite (alexgorevski.com)

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Alex Gorevski built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's deployed to Azure Static Web Apps via GitHub Actions.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES5+)
- Bootstrap 5 for layout
- Materialize CSS for components
- jQuery 3.7.1
- Font Awesome icons
- PostCSS with autoprefixer and cssnano for CSS processing
- esbuild for JavaScript bundling/minification
- ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier for code quality

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file (single-page application)
- `Content/stylesheets/` - CSS source files
- `Content/javascript/` - JavaScript source files
- `dist/` - Built/minified output files
- `Images/` - Image assets (with WebP optimized versions)
- `scripts/` - Build utility scripts
- `staticwebapp.config.json` - Azure Static Web Apps config with security headers

## Development Guidelines

### Commands

- `npm run build` - Build CSS & JS with minification
- `npm run watch` - Development watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint and Stylelint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run serve` - Start local dev server on port 8080

### CSS

- Source files are in `Content/stylesheets/`
- Built files go to `dist/stylesheets/`
- Use CSS custom properties from `variables.css`
- Follow existing patterns in `combined-purged.min.css`
- Run `npm run lint:css` before committing

### JavaScript

- Source files are in `Content/javascript/`
- Built files go to `dist/javascript/`
- Use ES5+ syntax for browser compatibility
- jQuery is available globally
- Run `npm run lint:js` before committing

### Images

- Provide WebP versions for all images
- Use `<picture>` elements with multiple sources
- Include proper `width`, `height`, `alt`, and `loading` attributes
- Optimize images with `npm run optimize:images`

### Security

- All scripts use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes
- After modifying JavaScript, run `npm run update:sri` to regenerate hashes
- Security headers are configured in `staticwebapp.config.json`
- Content Security Policy restricts resource loading

### Accessibility

- Include proper `aria-` attributes
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide `sr-only` text for icon-only links
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Include skip navigation link

## Don't Modify

- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (managed by npm)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configuration (modify with caution)
- Vendor files in `Content/*/vendors/`

## Before Committing

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
2. Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting
3. Run `npm run build` to generate production assets
4. Test locally with `npm run serve`
